# Weiss Schwarz

 Issues:
  - Closing the HOST/JOIN window will cause error when you tried to reopen it.
   - You will need to reopen the whole program again
  - The Host/Join button require you to open a port in your gateway in order to play with someone else, thus also lead to them knowing your IP Address.
   - Leave the port to 0.0.0.0 if you are hosting. (if does not work, use 127.0.0.1)
   - If you or the other player leave, you will not know that person left.
