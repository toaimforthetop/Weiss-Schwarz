Text:【AUTO】 【CXCOMBO】 When this card attacks, if a card named "Luminosité  Eternelle" is in your climax area, and the number of cards in your stock is five or less, look at up to four cards from the top of your deck, choose up to one 《Master》 or 《Servant》 or 《Homunculus》 character from among them, reveal it to your opponent, put it into your hand, and put the rest into your waiting room.
