Text:【AUTO】  【CXCOMBO】  When a card named "Our Stage!" is placed on your climax area, if your level is 3 or higher, put up to one card from the top of your deck into your stock, and all of your characters get +500 power until end of turn.
Text:【AUTO】  [(1)] This ability activates up to one time per turn. When your card is placed on the level area, you may pay the cost. If you do, look at up to four cards from the top of your deck, choose up to one character with "Yuri(ゆり)" or "Nanana(七菜)" or "Rii(リィ)" or "Hinako(ひなこ)" in its card name from among them, reveal it to your opponent, put it into your hand, and put the rest into your waiting room.
