Text:【AUTO】 [(2) Put 1 card from your hand into your waiting room] When this card attacks, if you have another 《Villain》 character, you may pay the cost. If you do, reveal the top card of your deck. If that card is a 《Villain》 character, deal X damage to your opponent, and this card gets +2000 power until end of turn. X is equal to that character's soul. (Damage may be canceled. Return the revealed card to its original place)
