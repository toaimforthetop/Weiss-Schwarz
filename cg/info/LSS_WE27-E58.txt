Text:【AUTO】 When this card is placed on the stage from your hand, your opponent chooses the number 0 or 1. Put the top card of your deck into your waiting room, and if that card is a card of a level that matches the number that your opponent chose, draw up to X cards. X is equal to the number that your opponent chose +1. (Climax are regarded as level 0)
