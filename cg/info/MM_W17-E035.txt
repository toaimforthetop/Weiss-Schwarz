Text:【AUTO】 When this card is placed on stage from your hand, if the number of cards in your deck is five or less, return all cards in your waiting room to your deck. If you do, shuffle your deck, choose one of your characters named "End of Karma for Madoka", put up to two cards from the top of your deck underneath that character as a marker, and all of your characters get +2000 power until end of turn.
