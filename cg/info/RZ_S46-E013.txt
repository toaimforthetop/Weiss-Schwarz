Text:【AUTO】 【CXCOMBO】 [Put a card named "Mistral Maiden" from your hand into your waiting room & Put this card into your waiting room] When this card is placed on the stage from your hand, if the number of cards in your deck is five or less, you may pay the cost. If you do, return all cards in your waiting room to your deck, search your deck for up to one character with "Felt(フェルト)" or "Old Man Rom(ロム爺)" or "Reinhard(ラインハルト)" in its card name, reveal it to your opponent, put it into your hand, search your deck for up to one card named "Royal Election Candidate, Felt", and put it on the stage position that this card was on. Shuffle your deck afterward, and that character gets +1000 power until end of turn.
